Are you coming to PyGotham in NYC this year? My colleague Anna Herlihy presents her mad science project [PyLLVM](https://github.com/aherlihy/PythonLLVM), a high-performance Python-to-machine-code compiler, at the start of the conference. In the last slot of the second day, I'll live-code a Python 3 async framework, first with callbacks and then with coroutines, in just thirty minutes!

* [PyLLVM: A compiler from Python to LLVM-IR](https://pygotham.org/2015/talks/218/pyllvm-a-compiler-from-py/)
* [How Do Python Coroutines Work?](https://pygotham.org/2015/talks/162/how-do-python-coroutines/)

Come one, come all, step right up, you are guaranteed to be wowed and entertained!
