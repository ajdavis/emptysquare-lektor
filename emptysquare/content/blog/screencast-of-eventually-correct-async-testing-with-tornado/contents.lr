In preparation for [my PyCon talk today in Montr&eacute;al](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/404/) I recorded and closed-captioned a screencast of it. This is a talk about testing asynchronous Python code with [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/). I also wrote [an article that covers this talk](/blog/eventually-correct-async-testing-tornado/), plus additional information about testing with coroutines.
