I'm starting to use color; here's some shots from [10gen's annual meeting](http://emptysquare.net/blog/what-its-like-to-work-for-10gen/), which was in Miami this year.

This is on Kodak Portra 400, with a Norita 66. Mistakes were made: Photographing from my hotel balcony, I didn't notice that the railing's edge was in the frame. And I shot 7 rolls but my flash only synced on a handful of photos. I'll reread the manual before I use the Norita again.
