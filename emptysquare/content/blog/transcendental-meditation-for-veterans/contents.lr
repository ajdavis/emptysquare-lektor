How interestingâ€”David Lynch, who's practiced Transcendental Meditation
for 40 years, [gives a million dollars to teach TM to
veterans](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57336149/david-lynch-gives-$1m-to-teach-vets-meditation/).
I've never practiced TM and I don't know much about it, besides that it
was popularized in the Sixties by the Maharishi and that The Beatles
famously went to India to learn it. In any case I doubt it matters much
which practice people learn if meditation is used therapeutically rather
than spiritually. I hope Lynch's gift helps a lot of people.
