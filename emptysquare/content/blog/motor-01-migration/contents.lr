summary: If you've been using Motor prior to the 0.1 release, here's how to upgrade.

body:

Motor (which is indeed my non-blocking driver for MongoDB and Tornado) [had a 0.1 release to PyPI yesterday](http://emptysquare.net/blog/motor-officially-released/). It had an odd history prior, so there are various versions of the code that you, dear reader, may have installed on your system. All you need to do is:

```
$ pip uninstall pymongo motor
$ pip install motor

```
Motor will pull in the official PyMongo, plus Tornado and Greenlet, as dependencies. You should now have Motor 0.1 and PyMongo 2.4.2:

```python
>>> import pymongo
>>> pymongo.version
'2.4.2'
>>> import motor
>>> motor.version
'0.1'

```
(The lore is: I started Motor last year in a branch of my fork of PyMongo, so you could've installed an experimental version of **both** PyMongo and Motor from there. Then we transferred Motor into its own repo within the MongoDB.org organization on January 15. And on February 1st a zealous fan actually grabbed the "Motor" package name on PyPI and uploaded my code to it, then transferred ownership to me, just to make sure I could use the name Motor.)
