summary: My PyCon 2015 talk about testing asynchronous code with Tornado's included AsyncTestCase.
---
body:

Async frameworks like Tornado scramble our usual unittest strategies: how can you validate the outcome when you do not know when to expect it? Here's my PyCon 2015 talk about Tornado's testing module. You can also [read my article on the topic](/blog/eventually-correct-async-testing-tornado/) or see [a screencast which I closed-captioned](/blog/screencast-of-eventually-correct-async-testing-with-tornado/).
