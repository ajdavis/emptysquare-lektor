If you are a software developer, then from time to time you will have to
solve an Interesting Problem in optimization, such as finding the best
matches on a dating site, or the right sharding key for a database
cluster. As often as not, such problems can be expressed as a network of
interrelated nodes, and if so, the problem probably has a name and a
known solution in graph theory. Your problem now is to know that name so
you can Google for the solution.

This book is a charming, breezy intro to graph theory, covering basic
terminology and some theorems related to planar graphs, topology,
map-coloring, matching, and optimization. I was a course shy of minoring
in math in college, and I've taken a handful of courses over subsequent
10 years, so I'm far from a math whiz. But I found nearly every proof
and problem accessible, sometimes requiring some effort, but never
insurmountably hard. The book promises to be introductory, and I have
now been introducedâ€”the next time I run into a stumper while I'm
building software, I feel I have a far better chance of recognizing it
as a known problem with a standard solution. Highly recommended.
